# Expanding Book Cover

Recently, on Stack Overflow, I saw the following homework assignment:

> Write a Java program using Graphics to draw a rectangle book cover which fulfills the requirements below. You can decide the sizes for all required items by yourself.

> 1. The cover will include a circle, a pentagon, and a string consisting of your first name initial and last name initial. Each of them and background will have different colors. The canvas will have a color different than the colors of all other items.

> 2. The book cover will first show up at the top left corner.

> 3. Then the book cover will increase their size by the factor of 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 every 500ms.

I have no idea if the OP was supposed to use Processing or some other academic Java graphing package.  I used Java Swing.  Here's the GUI at 1.0.
